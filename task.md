Title: Game Availability Maintenance

As a: System Administrator
I want to: Manage the list of games available for matchmaking
So that: Only valid and updated games are considered during the matchmaking process

Acceptance Criteria:

Administrators must be able to:

Add new games to the matchmaking list.

Update existing game details (e.g., game modes, regions, or rules).

Remove games no longer supported or available.

The system must validate the data before making changes to ensure:

Game information is complete and correct.

The game is active and supported by the platform.

Changes to the list of available games must be immediately reflected in the matchmaking algorithm.

Additional Notes:

Ensure that changes to game availability do not disrupt ongoing matchmaking sessions.

Implement logging for all changes to the game list for audit and debugging purposes.

Provide a clear error message when invalid game data is submitted.
